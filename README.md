# Assignment-02

In this assignment, your goal will be to experiment with learning policies on simple reinforcement policies using different methods fro 5 x 5 gridworld problem

## Part 1: 
1.1. Estimate the value function for each of the states using solving the system of Bellman equations explicitly 

1.2. Estimate the value function for each of the states using iterative policy evaluation 

2.1. The optimal policy for the gridworld problem by explicitly solving the Bellman optimality equation  

2.2. The optimal policy for the gridworld problem using policy iteration with iterative policy evaluation 

2.3. The optimal policy for the gridworld problem by policy improvement with value iteration

## Part 2: 

1.1. Use the Monte Carlo method with exploring starts 

1.2. Use the Monte Carlo method without exploring starts but the Ïµ-soft approach 

2. Use a behaviour policy with equiprobable moves
